#Cassette tape emulation wrapper for the HTML5 audio tag 
html5 audio player 80's theme. load in two tracks with the id of song and songB to get the emulation of a cassette :)<
Currently you can 'turn the tape over' but the wheel of tape doesn't follow along with the effect. Really, if the tape is all rolled on the left hand side, then when you turn it over it would appear on the right etc. For this to be convincing it would need a rewind button so that you could reset the tape... at the moment there is no rewind and the job is being covered by the stop button, it is all still a work in progress. As it is it delivers as much as I need for what I would like so am going to roll with it and develop more as I go along.
